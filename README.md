## [Protect 1: Scraping an Online Database with Selenium + Extracting information from each webiste + text to JSON structure with OpenAI (Chat GPT) + Database Design](https://github.com/ICereghetti/project_funeral_homes.git)

This project involves freelance investigation work for a client who needed assistance in designing a comprehensive SQL database from scratch for their Funeral Homes website. The goal was to create a robust database that could be queried in multiple ways to gain different perspectives on the data. Additionally, the database needed to be flexible enough to accommodate future additions of new data.

### Deliverables

* [New Zealand's Funeral Homes Database](https://github.com/ICereghetti/project_funeral_homes/blob/b45ae90cea72fae99af1870f2f5ad925c75aeed4/funeral_homes_database.csv)
* [Python Code for Scraping and Formatting Text Data from Funeral Homes Websites using OpenAI](https://github.com/ICereghetti/project_funeral_homes/blob/1556a93cb6b031ada01dad035458566a79eef8a2/scrape_website.py)
* [JSON File with Samples of the Data Scraped from Websites](https://github.com/ICereghetti/project_funeral_homes/blob/b45ae90cea72fae99af1870f2f5ad925c75aeed4/samples.json)
* [Database Schema Document with the Recommended Main Structure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YKqOfKtCx-Bx4KtMh7m7fcoXkl7wU3KPQ9LuyQzWJus/edit#gid=954638511)

### Tools Used

1) Python (Selenium, OpenAI, BeautifulSoup, urllib, time)
2) SQL (BigQuery)
3) Google Docs

## [Protect 3: Festival Schedue in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ivan.cereghetti/viz/SampleSchedue/dash?publish=yes)

PDF schedues were having some issues to display the event's information. This issue was solved by replacing these schedues by an interactive Tableau Dashboard:
* Tooltip to show the artist/teacher name, genre/topic and personalized image.
* Solved minor fixes to display times properly
* Added parameter to change each day's schedues

## [Protect 4: The Movie Database API + ML Model + Twitter Bot](https://github.com/ICereghetti/project2_tmdb.git)

Develop a Machine Learning Model, using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to recommend movies in a Twitter Bot once a week. The model will be trained to predict the average user rating a week after a movie is released. To predict this value, we will use cast, popularity, genre and budget.

### Tools used

* Python
* Google Platform (Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Bigquery, Looker Studio)
