## [Protect 1: Festival Schedue in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ivan.cereghetti/viz/SampleSchedue/dash?publish=yes)

PDF schedues were having some issues to display the event's information. This issue was solved by replacing these schedues by an interactive Tableau Dashboard:
* Tooltip to show the artist/teacher name, genre/topic and personalized image.
* Solved minor fixes to display times properly
* Added parameter to change each day's schedues
