* Tooltip to show the artist/teacher name, genre/topic and personalized image.
* Solved minor fixes to display times properly
* Added parameter to change each day's schedues

## [Protect 4: The Movie Database API + ML Model + Twitter Bot](https://github.com/ICereghetti/project2_tmdb.git)

Develop a Machine Learning Model, using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to recommend movies in a Twitter Bot once a week. The model will be trained to predict the average user rating a week after a movie is released. To predict this value, we will use cast, popularity, genre and budget.

### Tools used

* Python
* Google Platform (Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Bigquery, Looker Studio)
